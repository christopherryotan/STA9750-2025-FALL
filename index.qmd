## About Me
<div class="about-text">
Hi everyone, I’m Christopher Tan! I began my undergrad planning to pursue a career in accounting, but towards the end of my senior year, I took a handful of programming classes and discovered how much I enjoyed the problem solving aspect. That led me to pursuing my Masters in Statistics, where I could learn to make sense of large amounts of data as well as understanding statistical methodologies. I’m especially interested in ML and data science, since they bring together coding and statistical analysis in meaningful ways. Looking forward to meeting you folks!
